#Home Work 1

##Overview:

For this homework assignment, I first made sure the original html files had proper semantic tags. After viewing the html file, I noticed there were 'div' tags with its own indivual class name throughout the html file. However, to make sure that the viewer who is viewing the html can easily navigate through the code, it is important to have semantic tags that gives meaning to the code. As an example, I replaced a 'div' tag that was named footer, to an actaul semantic tag named 'footer'.

Furthermore, I noticed that all of the icon and page images were missing an 'alt' attribute. Alt attributes discribes the icon/images in case the webiste has difficulties loading the particular images. 

For all the changes I have made to both html and css files, I made sure to provide comments to breifly explain the changes I have made. 

Lastly, I made sure a proper title was provided for the website.


##Deployment:

To upload the final edited files, I first created a personal repository and cloned to my computer. After which I was able to push the final files to the created repository.
